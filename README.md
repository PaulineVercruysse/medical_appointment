## Project: Investigate the "coming rate" at medical appointments in Bresil

Do all patients show up at medical appointment? If not, what could be the reason? <br>
This project analyses a __[database](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)__ of medical appointments and parameters on the patient and the appointment details. The most important parameter is if the patient shows-up or not to the appointment. The data are during the month of June 2016.
<br>
The code and details of the data analysis is in the jupyter notebook: Investigate_coming_rate_medical.ipynb<br><br>
The main question is: <br>
What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? <br><br>
For this project, we will focus more precisely on the questions below:
- **If the patient has a chronic disease (Diabetes, Hypertension, Alcoholism or Handicap), does it influence the coming rate?**
- **Does the age of patient affect the coming rate?**
- **Does the period between the scheduled day and the appointment make a difference in the coming rate?**
- **Does the day of the appointment make a difference?**
- **Does reminding the appointment with a text make a higher rate of coming?**
